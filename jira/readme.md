## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git git@github.com:intraordinaire/dust-labs.git
   cd jira
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following variables:

```
JIRA_SUBDOMAIN=your-jira-subdomain
JIRA_EMAIL=your-jira-email
JIRA_BASIC_AUTH_TOKEN=your-jira-api-token
DUST_API_KEY=your-dust-api-key
DUST_WORKSPACE_ID=your-dust-workspace-id
DUST_DATASOURCE_ID=your-dust-datasource-id
```

Replace the placeholder values with your actual Jira and Dust credentials.

## Configuration

You can adjust the following constants in the script:

- `ISSUES_UPDATED_SINCE`: Time range for fetching updated issues (default: '24h')
- `PROJECTS`: The projects you want to fetch the issues from (default: 'MME')

## Usage

Run the script using the following command:

```bash
npm run issues
```

This will execute the `jira-issues-to-dust.ts` script using `ts-node`.

## Script Details

### Functionality

1. **Fetching Jira Issues**: 
   - Retrieves all Jira issues updated within the last 24 hours (or as specified by `ISSUES_UPDATED_SINCE`).
   - Paginates through results to ensure all issues are fetched.

2. **Processing Issues**:
   - For each issue, formats the data into a structured text representation.
   - Includes details such as issue key, summary, description, status, assignee, comments, and more.

3. **Upserting to Dust**:
   - Creates or updates a document in the specified Dust datasource for each Jira issue.
   - Uses the Jira issue key as the unique identifier for the Dust document.

4. **Concurrency**:
   - Utilizes `p-limit` to control the number of concurrent requests to Dust API.

### Key Components

- `getIssuesUpdatedLast24Hours()`: Fetches recent Jira issues.
- `formatDescription()` and `formatComments()`: Helper functions to format Jira issue data.
- `upsertToDustDatasource()`: Sends formatted issue data to Dust.
- `main()`: Orchestrates the entire process.

## Troubleshooting

- **Jira API Errors**: 
  - Ensure your Jira credentials are correct in the `.env` file.
  - Check if you have the necessary permissions to access the Jira API.

- **Dust API Errors**:
  - Verify your Dust API key, workspace ID, and datasource ID in the `.env` file.
  - Ensure the specified datasource exists and you have write permissions.

- **Memory Issues**:
  - For large Jira instances, you might need to process issues in batches. Consider modifying the script to fetch and process issues in smaller time ranges.

For any other issues, check the console output for error messages and stack traces.
